This is a CLI text to speech app.
It's made by myself using Python3.

How does it work?
● At first, it takes an input of the path of a text file.
● Then it reads the file.
● At last, it speaks the content of the file with the help of a python package.

Note:
● It can read and speak only English, else it could throw an error.
